# Kiro Steering Document: Aesthetic & Vibe Guide

This document steers the AI's creative output to maintain a consistent aesthetic for the DreamStruct project. The desired "vibe" is a blend of futuristic minimalism, ethereal beauty, and organic-technological fusion.

## Core Aesthetic Vibe: "Ethereal Futurism"

Think clean lines, graceful curves, and a sense of weightlessness. Structures should feel advanced and almost magical, but still grounded in a recognizable reality. The mood is optimistic, serene, and awe-inspiring.
