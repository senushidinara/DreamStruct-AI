# Kiro Steering Document: Aesthetic & Vibe Guide

This document steers the AI's creative output to maintain a consistent aesthetic for the DreamStruct project. The desired "vibe" is a blend of futuristic minimalism, ethereal beauty, and organic-technological fusion.

## Core Aesthetic Vibe: "Ethereal Futurism"

Think clean lines, graceful curves, and a sense of weightlessness. Structures should feel advanced and almost magical, but still grounded in a recognizable reality. The mood is optimistic, serene, and awe-inspiring.

### Color Palette

The primary color palette should be cool and sophisticated, with vibrant accent colors.

-   **Primary Materials:**
    -   `purple`: Use a muted, deep purple (`#5B21B6`) as a base for solid structures. It should feel solid and calming.
    -   `teal`: Use a vibrant, energetic teal (`#14B8A6`) for accent platforms, bridges, or decorative elements.
-   **Special Materials:**
    -   `glass`: Should be highly refractive and slightly luminous, with a pale cyan tint (`#A5F3FC`). It should be used for windows, transparent floors, or energy conduits.
-   **Lighting:**
    -   In-scene lighting should be soft and diffuse, with emissive materials providing internal glows.
    -   Use point lights with subtle purple or cyan tints to create a dramatic, futuristic atmosphere.

### Architectural Style

-   **Favor Curves over Hard Angles:** While boxes are acceptable for basic forms, encourage the AI to incorporate spheres and cylinders. When generating complex structures, prompts should favor organic, flowing shapes.
-   **Asymmetry is Key:** Avoid perfectly symmetrical designs. Introduce asymmetry in the placement and rotation of floating elements to create a more dynamic and natural-feeling composition.
-   **Integration with Nature:** When applicable, suggest the integration of hovering rooftop gardens, cascading digital waterfalls, or structures that curve around an unseen natural element.

### Animation & Effects

-   **Movement:** Animations should be slow, subtle, and graceful. Think slow rotations, gentle bobbing, or a soft pulsating glow from emissive materials. Avoid fast, jerky movements.
-   **Material Effects:** The `glass` material should always have a subtle refractive shimmer. Metallic surfaces should have a soft, specular sheen rather than being mirror-like.

By following this guide, the AI will consistently produce architectural concepts that align with the unique and visionary aesthetic of DreamStruct.
